This is a command-line game that takes you through a day in the life of a typical Yalie. Choose your own path through the day, including when to get out of bed, and whether or not to cheat, and answer some questions in class along the way. Try to increase your well-being and decrease your hunger so that you go to bed happy and full, without getting Ex-Commed along the way. 

How to play:
Follow the prompts in the command-line to enter numbers corresponding to each choice you are given and to answer the questions posed to you by teachers.
